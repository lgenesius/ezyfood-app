# EzyFood Application
Android application project for mid exam in Mobile Programming subject (MOBI6059). Ezyfood is about an application for order foods and drinks.

## Description
In this exam project, there is no database utilization, so I used class contain arraylist with singleton pattern. There is also the use of recycler view in this project.
